# Leim Tools
A congregate of tools used to visualize TTRPG elements and help content creators (mostly me for now tbh) build their worlds.

## Timeline
Visual helper for time-related data, such as events, eras and characters. Helpful to know how old a character is while something is happening in the world, or how far two events are separated in the timeline.
